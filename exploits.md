```
This code provides a simple proof of concept exploit for each vulnerability found in the original code. Each function takes the necessary input and demonstrates how an attacker could exploit the vulnerability.

Note that these exploits are not meant to be run on a production system, but rather used as a learning tool to understand how to prevent such vulnerabilities.

Also note that the Insecure Password Storage Exploit uses `passlib` library for password hashing and verification. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using pip: `pip install passlib`

This is my best effort to provide a clear, concise, and easy-to-understand proof of concept exploit for each vulnerability found in the original code.
