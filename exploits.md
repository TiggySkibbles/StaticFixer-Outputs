Note: This is a basic implementation of proof-of-concept exploits for each vulnerability. Please do not use these exploits in production as they may cause harm to the application and its users.

Each exploit can be run separately on any machine by changing the `url` variable in the respective script. For example, to run the SQL injection exploit, save `sql_injection.py` in a file, then run it with Python: `python sql_injection.py`.
